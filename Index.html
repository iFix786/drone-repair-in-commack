He was extremely kind, patient & professional. My phone has been working great ever since. (I got it fixed a few months ago) I recently went there to get my iPad screen fixed & just like last time, everything went really well! I cannot recommend him enough!! Also they are very fair when it comes to prices. I have tried other places in the past & they were either overpriced, or completely ripped me off & were very rude. Tolga is the only one who has been completely professional & honest the whole way through. Thank you guys so much!",
